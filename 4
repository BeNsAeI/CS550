Questions of the day:
Overal:
- Masters students assignments/information/canvas (what applies to us)
- Resume
- The glut issue
- masters guidance, directions advices
Context:
- Can we have transformations after introducing vertecies
Assignment:
- Solid body or wireframe?
___

- Orientation of objects can be used to detect cracks in model
- Order implies how edges are created
- Convexity is important for efficiency and optimization
- GLUXxx turns non convex models to triangles and keeps it
- PolyPartition too takes care of it and gives you an array of triangles
- Planer matters cause we don't want to see both sides of object at the same time

___
Assignment:
- Draw something in 3D
- it needs atleast 100 x,y,z cordinates
- 5 colors
- 3D rotation and scaling
___

Transformations:
- Translation: moving without changing orientation
 - glTranslatef(tx, ty, tz);
- Rotation: change orientation without moving
 - glRotatef(degrees, ax, ay, az);
- Scaling: change size scale representation multiplier
 - glScalef(sx,sy,sz);
 - uniform scaling implies all scale factors are the same
ORDER MATTERS:
- order happens reversal of appearance in code:
- line happened: 3(2(1(verticies))) (first is processed last)
