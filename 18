Transparency (Wrong terminology)
- Blending (This is closer to what happens)
- it is a subtractive process

glMaterialfv(GL_side_type, rgba)
 - GL_BACK_AMBIENT, GL_FRONT_DIFFUSE
 - glColor4f(r,g,b,a)

This is what to do:
 - glEnable(GL_BLEND)
 - Draw soolid things first
 - make z buffer readonly
  - glDepthMask(GL_FALSE)
- in Display()
 - glBlendFunc(src,dst)
  - GL_SRC_ALPHA
  - GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA
  - C' = aS + (1-S)
 - Draw the transparent
 - glDepthMask(GL_TRUE)
 - glDisable(GL_BLEND)

* if we are worried about Z-Buffer being changed after transparency why don't we 
do the transparency first or why don't we do back geometry first?
