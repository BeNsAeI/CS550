More on texture:
- Globe is easy to get SandT cordinates
 - easy code to achieve

Project 3: distort the globe
___

- Don't forget to call the animate function

- Texture = BmpToTexture("file.bmp",&width, &height); // needs to be a 24 -bits

___

Setting up Textures:

- setting the wrapping constants:
 - repeat (repeats after the T or S runs to 1 
 - clamps (Keeps the last parameter for all the leftover pixels)

- Setting the filters:
 - nearest, maps to the closest possible texel (not recommended)
 - linear interpolation (recomended)

- Texture Environment modes:
 - Replace: Like a sticker (decal)
 - Modulate: allows color of the object shine throught the texture
  - Using for lighting and texturing

How to read the texture in:
- glTextImage2D

Texture Object:
- all objects live in GPU memory
- gluint tex0;
- glGenTextures(1,&tex0);
- glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, tex0); // pushes the texture to GPU memory
- glTextParametter
- glEnvf
- glTextImage2D

Now in display:

- bind: glBindTexture()
- draw: glBegin
