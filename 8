Assignment:
- Camera looks a negative z
- use glutPerspective()
- push matrix and pop matrix
- Do the transformations
- scale and translate the the blades properly
- rotate it to control it's spinning
- take it a step at the time
- Tell glut main loop to animate
 - Global variable float Time
 - define MS_IN_THE_ANIMATION_CYCLE
 - int ms = glutGet(get_elapsed_time); //ms
 - ms %= ms_in_the_animation_cycle
 - Time = (float)ms / (float)ms_in_the_animation_cycle
___

Frame buffer continues:
- Alpha: Transparency

Z Buffer:
- from 0(near plane) to FFFFFF (far plane)
___

Texture Mapping:
- Texel -> Texture Pixel

              T = 1

- OBJ files can contain texture
- Assign s and T to vertex
- becareful where transition happens
- becareful about patterns evenly transitioning
