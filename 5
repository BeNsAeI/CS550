Questions:
- Is there a way to know if an object would show up in the view so we won't render it?
- Isn't it better to keep precious VRAM for textures and heavier things other than lists?
___

- Orthographic projection
 - glOrtho(xl,xr,yb,yt,zn,zf)
- Perspective projection
 - glPerpective(fovy,aspect,zn,zf)

- These define a viewing volume

glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glLoadidentity();
___

Arbitrary viewing

- gluLookAt(ex,ey,ez, lx,ly,lz, ux,uy,uz);
- eye, look at pozition, Up vector (what is camera orientation)
___

How to adjust the camera:
- Set look at
- Set up vector
- Set eye x and y
- find eye z: 
 - DeltaE = H/(2tan(fovy/2))
___

Specifying Viewport:
- measured in pixels
- define window
- define from upper left corner
- There is a matrix stack
 - you can push or pop matrix
___
Lists
- nameOfList=glGenLists(1); // 1 identifier is given back
- glNewList: make all the calls
- glEndList: ends the list
- glCallList(nameOfList); // pulls the information back from the memory
___
