Ray casting:
- Lighting could be done if we draw another line from object to the light source
- We can generate mirrors this way
- Transparency and refraction snell's law of reflaction
 - Lenses
- Could be sped up

- At^2 + bt + c  = 0
- 2 real numvers
- 1 real -> they are same
- 2 complex numbers

Sub space scattering
- light does not got in and bounce out
- light goes in but bounces back out somewhere else

Animation
- Keyframes
 - Keyframes: you deploy major checkpoints (you do this)
 - in-betweening: fill in between key framse (computer does this)
-
