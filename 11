- Cross product is implemented on project 2 (heli.hpp)
- dot product:
 - gives you a scalar number |A|.|B|.cos theta
 - gives us the cosine if both are unit vectors

Shading:
- multipass algorithm
- imagine lightsource is an eye
- everything that eye doesn't see is where light won't be and shadows will be casted

Light sources:
- Point
- Directional
- Spotlight

- Colors could be calculated by multiplying

Options:
- Global scene ambient red, gree, blue
- Position xyz
- ambient rgb
- diffuse rgb
- specular rgb
- material reaction to ambient
- material reaction to diffuse
- material reaction to specular
- shininess

- glLightModelfv(GL_LIGHT_MODEL_AMBIENT, MulArray3(.3f,white))
- set ambient to 0

- Helper functions:
 - Array3
