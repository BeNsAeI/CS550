- STL: Object must only be triangles
- STL: Legal Solid - Two manafold - Water tight - Definite inside and outside
- STL: Compuned objects need to be merged (Boolean Union)
- STL: No cracks  in the model - Every edge should be bound to only 2 triangles
- STL: Faces - Edges + Vertecies - Inner Edges loops = 2(Bodies - Genus(number of through holes))
- STL: Handle Overhangs

StereoGraphics:
- Works on the basis that two eyes see things slightly differently

Cyclops Model:
- Rotate the scene slightly to fake what other eyes see
- Vertical Paralex:
 - Problem with this is that it is moving points further and others closer
 - This means some points look bigger and some other look smaller
 - This means the view doesn't work in perspective
- Lets do it for Ortho only:
 - This theoretically solves the problem, but brain has learned to counter this
 - it makes it look larger than it supposed to
- So we ditch the cyclops model
