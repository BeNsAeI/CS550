Computer graphics history:

- 1950s
 - Pen plotter
 - Computer controlled scopes for displaying things

- 1960s
 - Graphics as we know it today
 - first monitors (CRT tubes)
 - first 3D graphics
 - VR headsets showed up here

- 1970s
 - 1977: starwars
 - Tektronix did graphics

- 1980s
 - Abyss
 - Last starfighter
 - computer graphics started showing up in movies
 - Pixar (lucuus films sold it to steve jobs)
 - Jen-hsun Huang CEO of nvidia was in OSU

- 1990s
 - Terminator
 - Starwars
 - Toystory
 - Voodoo

- 2000s
 - Mass use of GPUs

- Now:
 - More powerful
 - More memory
 - do more 
 - parallel computing
 - mobile phones, tablets etc (OpenGL-ES: embedded systems)
 - 3D movies and games
 - Vulkan
 - VR and AR

Graphics process:
- 3D geometry
 - Goal: make an image
 - Rendering: takes the data and prooduces an image
 - 3D Geometric Models
 - Model Libraries
 - Scanners and interactive modeling tools  etc
- Animations
 - Equations and mathematical models
 - design
 - capture
- Texturing
 - Scanned images
 - Procedurally generated (Compute)
 - Painted texture
- Surface information
 - How light interacts with the surface
 - Reflect, refract, transparency, subsurface scattering
- Lighting
 - How to illuminate
 - types: point, direct, spot, etc
 - Positioning
 - Colors
 - Intensities
- Rendering
 - Math behind all of them
 - generates a scene
 - produces an image
