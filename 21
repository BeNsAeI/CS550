Rendering:
- The rendering equation:
- B(P,d0,Lamda) = E(P,d0,Lamda) + Integral_Omega(B(P,d0,Lamda)f(Lamda,di,d0)(di.n^)d (omega))

Questions:
- Why am  I doing this
- How realistic does it have to be?
- How much  computation i need for this image
- Lighting is important?
- Illumination: global or local
- Do I need shadows?
- Reflections/refractions?
- How good these reflection/refractions need to be?

Lighting:
- Local, one object is affected by light source
- Global: how does the reflection of light from others make it look like?

aproaches:
- Start from object (this is openGL approach)
- start from eye

Radiosity:
- B_i A_i = E_i A_i + p_i SUM(B_j A_j F_{j->i})
- B: Light energy (intencity)
- A: area
- E: Emitted intensity
- p: Reflectivity
- F: Form factor/ fraction

Ray tracing:
- start from eye and go to the object
- continues next lecture
